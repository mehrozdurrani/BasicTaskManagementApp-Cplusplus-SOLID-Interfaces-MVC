## Introduction

This project is designed to demonstrate key principles and patterns used in modern software development, specifically in C++:

### Pure Virtual Functions and Interfaces

In this project, you will see how C++ leverages pure virtual functions and abstract base classes to create interfaces. This is a fundamental concept in C++ for achieving polymorphism and code flexibility.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture

The project follows the MVC architectural pattern. It separates the application into three interconnected components:

1. **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic. It includes the `Task` class, which models tasks to be managed.

2. **View:** Handles user interface and presentation. Users interact with the application through the console.

3. **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It manages user input, modifies the Model as needed, and updates the View accordingly.

### SOLID Principles

The project demonstrates the SOLID principles, a set of five design principles that help create maintainable and scalable software:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

## Features

- Task creation, modification, and deletion.
- Listing all tasks.
- Team management, add user, remove user.
- Listing team tasks
- Marking tasks as completed.

## Usage

To compile and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the code:

```Main.cpp``` is the entry point.
